        <h2>1. Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my blog! Today we are embarking on an exciting journey of
          learning how to maneuver through GIT.Before everything else set up
          your development environment and create all the necessary files and
          folders.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>2.What is git</h2>
        <p>
          Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to
          track changes, collaborate, and manage software projects. Git Bash is
          a command-line interface (CLI) for using Git on Windows systems. To
          install Git Bash, download the latest version from the official Git
          website and follow the on-screen instructions. After installation, you
          can launch Git Bash from the Start menu or by searching for it on your
          computer. Git Bash provides a Unix-like environment, allowing you to
          run Git commands and access a variety of tools and utilities.
        </p>

        <h2>3.Installing Git</h2>
        <p>
          go to
          <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">
            https://git-scm.com/download/win</a>
     <p>Once the download is complete, run the Git installer (.exe file) that you downloaded</p>
      <p><b>Setup Wizard:</b> Follow the instructions in the setup wizard. You can generally accept the default settings unless you have specific preferences to customize.</p>
<p><b>Choose Components:</b> During the installation process, you'll have the option to choose which components to install. Make sure "Git Bash Here" is selected if you want to use Git from the command line.</p>
<p><b>Adjusting your PATH environment</b> When prompted, choose the default option "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" to add Git to your PATH environment, which allows you to use Git from the command line.</p>
<p><b>Complete Installation:</b> Once the installation is complete, click "Finish" to exit the setup wizard.
        </p>

        <h2>4.Configuring Git</h2>
        <p>
          1.Open Git Bash and run the<b>
            git config --global user.name "Your Name"
          </b>
          command to set your name for Git commits. 1.Run
          <b> git config --global user.email "your@email.com"</b> to configure
          the email address associated with your Git account. 1.Use
          <b> git config --list</b> to view all your current Git configuration
          settings and ensure they are correct.

        <h2>5. Intializing a Git repository</h2>
        <h3>1.Create a New Repository</h3>
        <p>
          Run the git init command in your project directory to initialize a new
          Git repository and start tracking your files. 2
        </p>
        <h3>2.Check Repository Status</h3>
        <p>
          Use the <b> git status</b> command to view the current state of your
          repository, including any untracked or modified files. 3
        </p>
        <image src="./assets/git-status.png" width="600px" </image>
        <h3>Add Files to Staging</h3>
        <p>
          Utilize <b> git add.</b> to selectively add files to the staging area,
          preparing them for the next commit.
        </p>
        <image src="./assets/git-add.png" width="600px"></image>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>6. Adding files to the staging area</h2>
        <p>
          To add files to the Git staging area, use the
          <b>git add . </b>
          command followed by the file name or directory. This
          prepares the changes to be committed to the repository. For example,<b>
            git add my_file.txt </b >
            <image src="./assets/git-add-file.png" width="600px"></image>
          will stage the file "my_file.txt" for the next commit. You can also
          use wildcards like <b>git add *.txt </b> to stage all text files in
          the current directory
        </p>
        <image src="./assets/git-add-all.png" width="600px"></image>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>7. Commiting changes</h2>
        <p>
          After adding files to the staging area using <b>git add </b>, the next
          step is to create a commit. Commits are snapshots of your bbase that
          you can reference later. To create a commit, use the
          <b> git commit -m "Commit message" </b>
          command. The -m flag allows you to provide a short, descriptive
          message explaining the changes in this commit.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>8. Branches</h2>
        <p>
          Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and
          continue to do work without messing with that main line.The way Git
          branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly
          instantaneous, and switching back and forth between branches generally
          just as fast. Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages workflows that
          branch and merge often, even multiple times in a day. Understanding
          and mastering this feature gives you a powerful and unique tool and
          can entirely change the way that you develop.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Creating a branch</h2>
        <p>
          Use the <b>git branch [branch-name]</b> command to create a new
          branch. This allows you to work on a feature or bug fix independently
          of the main code base.
        </p>
        <image src="./assets/git-branch.png" width="600px"></image>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>10. Viewing all branches</h2>
        <p>
          Viewing Branches the <b> git branch </b> command lists all branches in
          your repository. The active branch is marked with an asterisk. You can
          also use git branch -a to see remote branches.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>11. Switching active branches</h2>

        <h3>Checkout a Branch</h3>
        <p>
          Use the <b>git checkout [branch-name]</b> command to switch to a
          different branch. This allows you to work on a specific feature or bug
          fix separately from the main codebase.
        </p>
        <image src="./assets/git-checkout branch.png" width="600px"></image>
        <h3>Create and Switch Combine</h3>
        <p>
          <b>git checkout -b [new-branch-name]</b> to create a new branch and
          immediately switch to it in one command.
        </p>
        <image src="./assets/git-checkout-newbranch.png" width="600px"></image>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>12. Merging a branch</h2>
        <p>
          Merge a Branch To integrate the changes from a branch into the main
          bbase, use the <b>git merge [branch-name]</b> command. This will
          combine the specified branch with the currently active branch.
        </p>
        <image src="./assets/git-merge.png" width="600px"></image>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>13. Deleting a branch</h2>
        <p>
          Delete a Branch Once a branch has been merged, you can safely delete
          it using the <b>git branch -d [branch-name]</b> command. This will
          remove the branch from your local repository.
        </p>
